Overview

Insight Global is seeking a highly skilled Test & Validation Engineer to join our team. This role focuses on developing and validating advanced control systems using Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) platforms. The ideal candidate will have strong expertise in MATLAB/Simulink, embedded controls, and real-time simulation environments.


Required Skillsets:
- Bachelor’s degree in electrical, controls, power, mechatronics, or related field
- 3–7+ years of experience in embedded or controls test and validation with HIL
- Strong MATLAB and Simulink skills, including Simulink Test, Simulink Real-Time, and Simscape Electrical
- Scripting experience with Python and VBA
- Hands-on experience with Speedgoat using ~1 ms base rates, fixed-step solvers, rate transitions, and task partitioning
 

Day-to-Day Responsibilities

- Build and operate HIL rigs: configure Simulink Real-Time on Speedgoat, map I/O harness, manage deterministic scheduling, and optimize solver settings for ~1 ms steps
- Model plants: create and maintain Simulink and Simscape Electrical models for PCS/inverter, filters, transformer, battery, and BMS; validate model fidelity against bench and site data
- Perform HIL simulations: connect Schneider M580 PLC to Speedgoat via Modbus TCP; verify commands, telemetry, time sync, alarms/events, and fail-safe sequences end-to-end
- Author requirement-based tests: derive MiL, SiL, and HIL cases for power/VAR control, ramp-rate, frequency/voltage response, SoC management, thermal derates, ride-through, startup/shutdown, and fault scenarios
- Automate regression testing: implement scripted test suites with pass/fail metrics, waveform capture, and auto-reports; integrate with Git and CI workflows
- Manage defect lifecycle: analyze logs, isolate root causes across controller, PLC, and plant model; file issues, verify fixes, and maintain full traceability from requirement to test to result
- Ensure rig reliability and safety: maintain configurations, calibrations, and harnesses; implement health checks; observe lab safety protocols
 



First Day Questions:
- Procedure for requesting time off
- Procedure for requesting additional software 
- Is it ok to connect my own usb devices and monitors to work computer
- More detail on access to target machine 


Context on the system
- Using PLC coder for controller code generation?
- controller code deployment process on PLC

Understanding priorities:
- Test scenarios that are more critical than others?
- Maturity of current test automation efforts, what percentage of tests run with automated scripts vs manual execution?
