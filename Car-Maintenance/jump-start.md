# How to Jump Start a Car
Jumpstarting a car is a temporary fix to start a car with a dead battery by connecting a working batter (from another car or portable pack) using jumper cables. This provides the car with the dead battery enough power to crank its engine. 

## Jump Start using Another Car with a Working Battery
Car A - Car with dead battery \
Car B - Car with working battery\

    Safety Note:
    - Make sure the leads (or ends) of the jumper cables never touch each other during this process
    - Make sure the two cars are separated and do not touch each other


1) Drive Car B near Car A so that their hoods are close enough to each other for jumper cables to connect their batteries.

2) Turn off both vehicles, make sure that both vehicles are **completely off**

3) On Car A
    1) Take the RED jumper wire and connect one of the leads to the RED (or POSITIVE) end of the battery in Car A. In the meantime, rest the BLACK jumper wire lead for Car A on a piece of plastic on Car A, not touching any bare metal.
        - Make sure the metal piece of jumper cable lead clips onto the metal piece of the car battery completely

4) On Car B
    1) Take the other end of the RED jumper wire, and connect the lead to the RED (or POSITIVE) end of Car B's battery.  
    2) Take the other end of the BLACK jumper wire, and connect the lead to the BLACK (or NEGATIVE) end of Car B's battery.
